	Research Paper Toolbox
	</h1>
	<p>
	Constructing a research paper is an integral 
part of being a graduate student in the Information 
Architecture, Technical Communication and Information 
Design, and Technical Communication programs at IIT. 
	</p> 
 
	<p>
	There is no right or wrong way to put a paper 
 together, but there are a wealth of tools available
 to make the process efficient and manageable. In 
 this course, you will find an explanation of the 
 basic steps involved in writing a research paper,
 as well as a selection of tools that complement 
 certain steps. 
	</p>
 
	<p>
	If you are new to writing research papers, 
this course will guide you through each of 
the basic steps; even if you are an experienced
 writer, you can still refresh your knowledge 
 with one or more lessons. To begin,
